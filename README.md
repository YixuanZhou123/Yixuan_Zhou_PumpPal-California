PumpPal California is an interactive dashboard designed for drivers in California to explore and manage information about gas stations.

It not only provides essential details such as the station name, address, city, and overall rating, but it also allows users to filter, search, and select stations based on their preferences. Drivers can make informed decisions about where to refuel and access the most up-to-date station details.

The interactive functionality includes:

1. **Station List and Filtering**
Users can filter the gas station list based on several criteria:
(1) Type of fuel offered (e.g., Regular, Premium, Diesel).
(2) Search method (by city or address).
(3) Search input to narrow down results dynamically.

2. **Interactive Map and Station Selection**
Users can select or deselect stations in two ways:
(1) By clicking on a station in the list, which zooms the map to the station's location at a specific scale.
(2) By clicking directly on a station's point on the map.

3.**Reset and Explore All Stations**
Users can reset their filters or selections to return to the initial view showing all available stations.

The dashboard is designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience for drivers, enabling them to explore fuel options conveniently and effectively plan their journeys.
